Task 0

· Install Metamask wallet.
· Change the network to Sepolia testnet.
· Find Google Sepolia Faucet
· Collect some coins (you need to do it over several days)
· Install some (free) VPN setup (proton has some free options)


Installing

· If you want, install Linux VM
· Install IPFS node – such that you can interact with IPFS commands
· Install NodeJS, and NPM
· Install hardhat
· Test by generating a demo project with npm hardhat init


Task 1

· (Unfortunately) Remix does not work with TOR. So we might need to use VPN.
· Using Remix IDE online, create a simplest “hello world” smart contract.
· Deploy it onto the internal node
· Interact with the functions from your smart contract.
· Observe the PURE and VIEW functions. Do they need to use gas?
· Observe the functions that modify the state. Is the gas used? How is it consumed?




Task 2

· Task should be carried out on your operating system of choice, however, networking configurations, 
local webserver startup and so on have been tested on Linux and Mac but not on Windows, so you may experience barriers on Windows.

· Repeat your contract experimentation from Task 1 but this time locally on your own computer, using hardhat framework

· Install hardhat (requires NPM, NODEJS)
· Install Ganache network

· Install IPFS node, and play with it – store a file, and access it via a web browser gateway,
